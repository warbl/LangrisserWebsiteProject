package model.webUser;

/* The purpose of this class is just to "bundle together" all the 
 * data values that you would get from a single row of a result set
 * from joining the web_user database table with the user_role table. 

 * All fields are declared as type String (even fields might be a
 * different type in the database, like date or decimal). We do this 
 * for two reasons: 
 *     1. so we can store nicely formatted data (e.g., with $s in it). 
 *     2. so we can store "pre-validated" data that might not be able to 
 *        be converted to a valid value of the given type, for example 
 *        a user might have made a data entry error.  
 * 
 * There are no getter or setter methods since we are not trying to
 * protect this data in any way.  We want to let Java/JSP code have have
 * free access to put data in or take it out. */
